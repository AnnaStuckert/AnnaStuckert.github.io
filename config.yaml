    title: About Me
    icon: fas fa-user
    description: I am a PhD student at the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at University of St Andrews, where I am part of the Allodi Lab. In my research I am studying how emotion processing changes in health and disease. Specifically I investigate changes in emotional processing in a mouse model of Frontotemporal Dementia using machine-learning based behavioural analysis, calcium imaging, and histology. I’m an advocate for open-source software, and am part of the 2024 cohort of the DeepLabCut AI Residency program.

          - I am pursuing a PhD in Neuroscience, where I will be studying Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) in a transgenic mouse model of the disease. The project investigates emotion expression changes as a symptom of the disease and seeks to classify emotions in mice based on facial expressions when navigating a VR environment, and during social interaction, and compare this ability in sick and healthy mice, and furthermore look at the neural correlates of disease and causal mechanisms using calcium imaging and optogenetics.
