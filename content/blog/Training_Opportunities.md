# Training opportunities

## [BAMB - Barcelona summer school on Advanced Modelling of Behavior](https://www.bambschool.org)

### Course philosophy
Our goal isâ€‹ to teach advanced techniques in model-based analysis of behavior (humans and other animals) to cognitive and computational neuroscientists at PhD and early career levels. This will be achieved through structured lectures and talks, together with a strong focus on hands-on tutorials and group projects aimed at making the obtained knowledge directly applicable to the participants' own research. Our goal is that the trainees acquire both the conceptual basis and the technical skills that will enable them to pursue a full modeling approach on their own when they come back to their lab. 

## [DeepLabCut AI Residency](https://www.deeplabcutairesidency.org)

### Course philosophy

The DeepLabCut AI Residency Program is for underrepresented groups in computer science. The program is funded by a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
DeepLabCut is used for research in a growing range of fields: from animal conservation, to biomechanics, to neuroscience. Many end users do not have formal training in computer science, deep learning, or experience with best-practices in programming.

To help ease this gap and train the next-gen, this new program is designed to host paid AI Residents exclusively selected from groups underrepresented in computer science. 

The goal of this DeepLabCut AI Residency is to train and empower students to use and modify code, develop new add-ons, and become leaders within the DeepLabCut consortium and the open source community more broadly. To this end, our Residency Program will aim to recruit both more experienced users and novice users -- by having a mixture of backgrounds (both in terms of lived experiences and work experiences) working together, we will provide a nurturing environment where they can both learn more about DeepLabCut, open source practices, and develop new skills, while at the same time enabling them to contribute. 

## [Euro SciPy](https://euroscipy.org)
Euro SciPy is a conference for the Python community, allegedly with a mainly academic focus, and very cheap for students. Financial aid often available to underrepresented groups (e.g. cover ticket and some maintenance). Often will have both tutorials, sprints, talks, poster sessions - a very varied range of opportunities.

## [PyData Conference](https://pydata.org/paris2024/)
Many PyData Conferences exist, the example is PyData Paris. This conference is also aimed at the Python community with the focus more on industry, and also be quite cheap for students. 

## [Riken CBS Summer Program](https://cbs.riken.jp/en/summer/)
The RIKEN Center for Brain Science (RIKEN CBS), located just outside Tokyo, Japan, offers a summer program to train advanced students interested in brain function. Applicants may choose either a 2-month laboratory internship (Plan A) within a RIKEN CBS laboratory or an intensive 5 days lecture course (Plan B) featuring a distinguished international faculty. Those participating in the internship may also enroll in the lecture course. The course consists of an intensive 5 days lecture series featuring distinguished international faculty and poster sessions to be put on by the program participants. These two components are equally important for the students to deepen their insight and enhance their expertise in neuroscience. While the lectures serve to introduce them to cutting-edge research being carried out throughout the world, the student poster session allows them to experience the work of their colleagues and share their own research. We encourage the students to take full advantage of the wonderful opportunities offered by this program to broaden the horizons of their research.
Attendees come from wide-ranging academic backgrounds and are usually enrolled in graduate courses or have recently embarked on postdoctoral research.
